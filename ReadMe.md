# **DevConnect - A Developer Community Platform**

## **Project Description**  
DevConnect is a web-based platform for developers to share knowledge, ask questions, and collaborate on projects. It includes user authentication, a post-based discussion system, a comment section, and a like system. The backend is built with **Node.js (Express.js)**, and the frontend is built using **React.js**. MongoDB is used for storing user and post data.

## **Roadmap to Build DevConnect**  

### **1. Setup the Project**  
- Initialize a Node.js project:  
  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```  
- Install required backend dependencies:  
  ```bash
  npm install express mongoose dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors multer
  ```  
- Set up the project structure:  
  ```

### **2. Build the Backend (Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB)**  
- **Set up Express.js server** (`index.js`).  
- **Connect MongoDB using Mongoose**.  
- **Implement user authentication:**  
  - Hash passwords using `bcryptjs`.  
  - Use `jsonwebtoken` for authentication.  
  - Middleware to protect routes.  
- **Create API routes for:**  
  - User authentication (`/api/auth`).  
  - Profile management (`/api/profile`).  
  - Post creation and listing (`/api/posts`).  
  - Comments & likes (`/api/comments`).  
- **Implement CRUD operations for posts and comments.**  

---

### **3. Build the Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)**  
- Install React and dependencies:  
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app frontend
  cd frontend
  npm install axios react-router-dom tailwindcss
  ```  
- **Set up React Router for navigation.**  
- **Create UI components:**  
  - Navbar, Footer, PostCard, CommentBox, etc.  
- **Create pages:**  
  - Login, Signup, Dashboard, Create Post, View Post.  
- **Connect frontend to backend using Axios.**  

---

### **4. Implement Post & Discussion System**  
- Allow users to create, edit, and delete posts.  
- Display a list of posts with like & comment buttons.  
- Implement a rich-text editor for better post formatting.  

---

### **5. Implement Like & Comment System**  
- Allow users to like/unlike posts.  
- Add a comment section with nested replies.  
- Update UI in real time using React state management.  

---

### **6. Implement Search & Filtering**  
- Add a search bar to find posts by keywords.  
- Add filters (most liked, most recent, trending, etc.).  

---

### **7. Real-time Features (Optional - Advanced)**  
- Implement WebSockets using `socket.io` for real-time notifications.  
- Notify users when someone comments on their post.  

---

### **8. Final Testing & Deployment**  
- Write unit tests using Jest/Mocha.  
- Optimize API responses and frontend performance.  
- Deploy backend to **Render/Vercel** and frontend to **Netlify/Vercel**.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
### **Backend**  
- Node.js (Express.js)  
- MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- JWT Authentication  
- bcryptjs for password hashing  
- Multer for file uploads  
- WebSockets (`socket.io`) (optional)  

### **Frontend**  
- React.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- React Router  
- Axios for API requests
